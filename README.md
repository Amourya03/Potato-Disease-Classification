## About the Project

Potato cultivation is essential for food security, but diseases can significantly reduce crop yields. This Potato Disease Classification Model helps farmers and researchers identify diseases in potato plants by analyzing images of the leaves. The project consists of two main components:

- **Machine Learning Model**: The backend includes a machine learning model trained to classify diseases in potato leaves. It uses a deep learning model.

- **React.js Frontend**: The frontend is a user-friendly web application built with React.js. It allows users to upload images of potato leaves and get disease classification results instantly.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amourya03/Potato-Disease-Classification.git
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd potato-disease-classification
3. Install the required dependencies for the React.js frontend:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
